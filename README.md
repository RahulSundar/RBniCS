### 0. Introduction
**RBniCS** is an implementation in **FEniCS** of several reduced order modelling techniques (and, in particular, certified reduced basis method and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition-Galerkin methods) for parametrized problems. It is ideally suited for an introductory course on reduced basis methods and reduced order modelling, thanks to an object-oriented approach and an intuitive and versatile python interface. To this end, it has been employed in several doctoral courses on "Reduced Basis Methods for Computational Mechanics".

**RBniCS** can also be used as a basis for more advanced projects that would like to assess the capability of reduced order models in their existing **FEniCS**-based software, thanks to the availability of several reduced order methods (such as reduced basis and proper orthogonal decomposition) and algorithms (such as successive constraint method, empirical interpolation method) in the library.

Several tutorials are provided. This software is also a companion of the introductory reduced basis handbook:

### 1. Prerequisites
**RBniCS** requires
* **FEniCS-X** for computations during the offline stage;
* **numpy** and **scipy** for computations during the online stage.

Additional requirements are automatically handled during the setup.

### 2. Installation and usage
Simply clone the **RBniCS** public repository:
```
git clone https://gitlab.com/RBniCS/RBniCS.git
```
and install the package by typing
```
python3 setup.py install
```

### 2.1. RBniCS docker image
If you want to try **RBniCS** out but do not have **FEniCS** already installed, you can [pull our docker image from Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/rbnics/rbnics/). All required dependencies are already installed. **RBniCS** tutorials and tests are located at
```
